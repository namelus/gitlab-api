# GitLab API Member Management Demo Script
# ==============================================================================
#
# This script demonstrates how to use the GitLab API member management functions
# to add, list, and remove members from GitLab projects.
#
# USAGE:
#   bash examples/member-management-demo.sh [demo_mode]
#
# DEMO MODES:
#   interactive  - Interactive demo with user prompts
#   automated    - Automated demo with sample data
#   help         - Show usage information
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   - Valid GitLab Personal Access Token stored in ~/.env
#   - GitLab project ID or path to work with
#   - User email addresses to add as members
#
# ==============================================================================
